# tiny_ALU

A simple and from first principles 8 bit Arthimetic Logic Unit (ALU) for the purposes of learning. The ALU currently only has functionality for addition, subtraction, equal and magnitude comparison and logical left shift. 
See ALU_tb for simulation results. Haven't synthesized yet.

## Wishlist / TODO

1. UART RX module to set transfer commands to FPGA board from control PC
2. 7 Segment Display control to display calculation results on board display
3. More comments and further documentation
